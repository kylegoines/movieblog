                Horriable Bosses is a sequal to a movie I and noone else had the please to see on its near speed of light adventure to redbox. Upon google searching this move i see it is labled a comedy and that it is currently playing at 3 theaters near me. and that the list contiues for at least wed, thu, fri, yet beyond that your guess is as good as mine.

                Horrible Bosses 2 was made as reactionary movie to the guardians of the galaxy or marvel's the avengers. where once quite popular man from arrested development gets together a rag tag group of tv characters including but not limited to maybe the guy from dexter, jennifer anniston, charlie from alway sunny, funny man Jason Sudeikis and on hard times fish out of water actor christopher waltz. together, in just a little under a 70 minute running time. have to put an end to the throne of power and authority held commonly by black men in this day and age, played by jamie fox, of spiderman 2 fame.

                laughs abonund in this 67 minute sidesticher. 
                the characters are lively and great and barley seem to be viying for silver screen time. the movie opens with a that really funny thing you saw in the trailer and before you know it has you out the door in no time. honey leave it running, ill be right out!
                A delightful december caper film. this movie turns it up to oceans eleven!
                10 out of 10
